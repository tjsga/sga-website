# 2018 SGA Website #

Most people decide to put a fancy image here or something to impress the people looking at this GitHub and make it look official. I could care less.

## How to test this site ##

Pre-reqs: node.js, browser, brain

Run the run.sh file and visit localhost:8080

## How to edit this site ##

Step 1: **DON'T EDIT IT IN DIRECTOR UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR ARE DOING** (P.S. you most definitely DON'T know what you are doing if you haven't done this before)

Step 2: Clone the GitHub Repo, and if this is a new school year, make a new branch in GitHub, copying the master branch, otherwise switch to the branch of the current school year. (if you are stuck at this step after using Google, please give up editing the site, and find someone more qualified to take your position on SGA)

Step 3: Look at the site.json file and edit the appropriate values. **Keep a backup!** __If you mess up the site will crash__

Step 4: Merge the current year's branch to the master branch

Step 5: Pull the changes into director **after testing the site locally**
