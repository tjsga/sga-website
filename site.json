By designing new initiatives which support students and reviving tradition which brings the Colonial community together, I hope that we can create an environment where every student can make the most of their four years at TJ. Please feel free to contact me via facebook or by emailing me at 2019nkothari@tjhsst.edu. I’d be happy to hear your input on how we can move TJ forward."

While dedicating myself to the wellbeing of our student body next year, I also hope to guide SGA actions that will leave meaningful and long-lasting positive impact on the TJ community by reforming programs meant to help students, like BigSibs, the Honor Council, and communication with administration. Reach out to me any time on facebook or by email at 2019ephillip@tjhsst.edu if you have questions, want to discuss ideas, or have some concerns we can help to address.

In tandem with my fellow officers, I hope to tackle many issues facing our school including (but of course, not limited to) course workloads, mental health/stress, and transparency and communication between the administration and the student body. Of course, I also want to ensure that fun TJ traditions like homecoming are successful and better than ever! Most importantly, I want to maintain an open line of communication with the entire student body, so that I can continue to accurately represent YOUR views. Together, I know we can make real change happen, so if you have any ideas, questions, or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me on messenger or by email (2020myang@tjhsst.edu)."

During my term, I hope to raise involvement in SGA and school events as well as maintain an open line of communication between the students and the administration. I look forward to working alongside the TJ student leadership team to improve already existing initiatives and continue to address school-wide issues through policy. If you ever have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out through social media or by emailing me at 2019jhernand@tjhsst.edu.
