                The Executive Committee (ExComm) is a integral sub-group of the SGA. Its members act as representatives of the student body. The members work with the officers to organize events and activities throughout to year. While several ExComm positions may have more specific roles, all are working towards the goals of the SGA. Applications to be on ExComm are released every June after Class Council elections have been completed.
