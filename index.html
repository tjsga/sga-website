                        Welcome to Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology's school-wide Student Government Association's new home on the web! As you know, TJ is going through some very exciting times, and we want you to be a part of it with us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here at Jefferson, we not only challenge ourselves academically, but also extracurricularly. And so, tjSGA is pushing forward this year to not only continue school-wide traditions such as Homecoming Week, Dancing with the Faculty, Service Week, and J-Day, but also both establish new and revive discontinued traditions such as the February Snow Ball and March Volleyball tournament. Moreover, as we face obstacles such as the stigma against mental illness and TJ Renovation restrictions, we hope to continually find effective solutions for the student body.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Please don't hesitate to contactme or SGA at anytime with any concerns, suggestions, or questions and we'll do our best to address them.
                    </p>
                    <br />
